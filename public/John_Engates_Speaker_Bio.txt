John Engates is a pioneering researcher in Agentic AI and multi-agent systems, exploring how autonomous AI agents can collaborate to solve complex security challenges. With over 30 years at the intersection of distributed computing and cybersecurity, John has shaped how organizations defend their digital infrastructure—from building one of Texas's first ISPs to serving as Field CTO at Cloudflare (2021-2025), where he guided global enterprises through the convergence of AI and zero-trust security architectures.

As CTO at Rackspace for nearly 18 years, John helped launch OpenStack and the Open Compute Project while building security-first cloud infrastructure that supported everything from startups like YouTube to critical government systems. When Healthcare.gov crashed in 2013, he was among those called to the White House to help secure and stabilize the platform millions depended on.

Today, John's research focuses on how AI agent swarms can revolutionize cybersecurity—from autonomous threat detection and response to self-healing infrastructure. He serves on the boards of Frost Bank (NYSE: CFR) and James Avery Craftsman, mentors through TechStars, and remains a sought-after voice on the future of AI-powered security. His unique perspective bridges decades of building secure, scalable systems with cutting-edge research into how AI will transform how we protect them.
