## About Tempest

Tempest is a recreation of the groundbreaking 1981 arcade game by Atari. Known for its distinctive vector graphics, tube shooter gameplay, and progressive difficulty, Tempest was one of the first games to allow players to choose their starting level and featured a unique color-cycling aesthetic that became iconic in early arcade history.

## Implementation Details

This modern web implementation captures the essence of the original while leveraging current web technologies:

### Core Features
- **Authentic Gameplay**: Faithful recreation of the original mechanics including enemy behaviors and scoring
- **Vector-Style Graphics**: Clean, geometric visuals that honor the original's aesthetic
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Increasing challenge across levels with new enemy types and patterns
- **Smooth Controls**: Responsive keyboard controls for precise movement

### Technical Highlights
- Pure JavaScript implementation with no external game engine dependencies
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering with optimized draw calls
- Web Audio API for dynamic sound effects
- Modular code architecture for maintainability

## Why Build a Classic Game?

Recreating classic games serves multiple purposes:

1. **Technical Challenge**: Implementing smooth gameplay and collision detection teaches fundamental programming concepts
2. **Historical Preservation**: Keeping classic gaming experiences accessible to new generations
3. **Design Study**: Understanding what made these games compelling despite technical limitations
4. **Performance Optimization**: Working within constraints to achieve 60fps gameplay

Building Tempest connected my interest in distributed systems with real-time performanceâ€”the same principles that make cloud infrastructure responsive apply to creating smooth gaming experiences.
