## Project Overview

The Spotify Playlist Importer simplifies playlist management by providing programmatic access to create, modify, and synchronize playlists. Whether you're migrating from another service, backing up playlists, or managing large music collections, this tool streamlines the process.

## Key Features

- **Bulk Import**: Import playlists from CSV, JSON, or other music services
- **Playlist Synchronization**: Keep playlists synchronized across accounts or services
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintain track order, descriptions, and playlist metadata
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of API limits and missing tracks
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple playlists efficiently

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Python-based CLI tool with modular design
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for secure API access
- Rate limiting and retry logic for API reliability
- Async operations for improved performance

### Spotify API Integration
- Utilizes Spotify Web API for playlist operations
- Handles pagination for large playlists
- Implements search fallbacks for track matching
- Respects API rate limits with intelligent throttling

## Use Cases

1. **Service Migration**: Moving playlists from other streaming services
2. **Playlist Backup**: Creating backups of your Spotify playlists
3. **Collaborative Playlists**: Merging playlists from multiple users
4. **Music Discovery**: Importing curated lists from music blogs or forums

## Lessons Learned

Building this tool reinforced important distributed systems principles:
- **API Design**: Working with RESTful APIs and understanding their constraints
- **Authentication**: Implementing secure OAuth flows
- **Rate Limiting**: Designing systems that respect service boundaries
- **Error Recovery**: Building resilient systems that handle failures gracefully

This project demonstrates how understanding distributed systems helps create reliable tools that interact with cloud services effectively.
