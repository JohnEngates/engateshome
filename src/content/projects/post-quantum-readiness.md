## Overview

The Post Quantum Readiness Assessment provides organizations with a structured approach to evaluate their preparedness for the quantum computing era. As quantum computers advance, they pose a significant threat to current cryptographic systems, making the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) critical for maintaining security.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Assessment Framework**: Covers technical infrastructure, organizational readiness, and risk management
- **Actionable Insights**: Provides specific recommendations based on assessment results
- **Industry-Aligned**: Based on NIST standards and industry best practices
- **Self-Service Tool**: Organizations can perform their own assessment without external consultants

## Why It Matters

Quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption standards may arrive within the next decade. Organizations need to start preparing now because:

1. **Migration Takes Time**: Transitioning cryptographic systems is complex and time-consuming
2. **Data Harvesting Risk**: Adversaries may be collecting encrypted data now to decrypt later
3. **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory bodies are beginning to mandate PQC preparedness
4. **Supply Chain Impact**: Your security depends on your vendors' quantum readiness

## Technical Approach

The assessment evaluates multiple dimensions:

- Current cryptographic inventory and dependencies
- System architecture and upgrade capabilities
- Organizational maturity and governance
- Risk assessment and prioritization
- Migration planning readiness

This tool emerged from my research into how distributed systems must evolve for the quantum eraâ€”applying lessons learned from decades of infrastructure transitions to this critical security challenge.
