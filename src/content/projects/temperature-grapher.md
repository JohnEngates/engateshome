## Overview

The Temperature Grapher provides a complete solution for collecting, storing, and visualizing temperature data from various sources. Whether monitoring server rooms, environmental conditions, or experimental setups, this tool makes temperature trends visible and actionable.

## Features

### Data Collection
- Support for multiple sensor types and protocols
- Configurable sampling intervals
- Automatic data validation and error handling
- Multi-location monitoring capability

### Storage & Management
- Efficient time-series data storage using SQLite
- Data compression for long-term storage
- Automatic backup and rotation
- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON)

### Visualization
- Real-time graphs with live updates
- Historical trend analysis
- Multiple graph types (line, area, heatmap)
- Customizable time ranges and scales
- Statistical overlays (averages, trends, anomalies)

## Technical Architecture

### Design Principles
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns for collection, storage, and visualization
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new sensor types or visualization options
- **Performance**: Optimized for continuous operation with minimal resource usage
- **Reliability**: Handles sensor failures and network issues gracefully

### Implementation Details
- Python-based with minimal dependencies
- SQLite for reliable local storage
- Matplotlib for publication-quality graphs
- Configuration via YAML files
- Optional web interface for remote monitoring

## Use Cases

1. **Data Center Monitoring**: Track server room temperatures for optimal performance
2. **Home Automation**: Monitor and log household temperatures
3. **Scientific Research**: Collect precise temperature data for experiments
4. **Agricultural Applications**: Monitor greenhouse or storage conditions

## Connection to Distributed Systems

This project exemplifies distributed systems principles on a smaller scale:
- **Data Collection**: Similar to telemetry in large systems
- **Time-Series Storage**: Patterns used in monitoring infrastructure
- **Visualization**: Techniques applicable to system metrics
- **Reliability**: Handling failures in distributed sensor networks

Building tools like this reinforces the importance of observabilityâ€”whether monitoring temperatures or tracking the health of AI agent swarms, the principles remain the same.
